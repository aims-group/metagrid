# MetaGrid Scripts

This directory stores scripts to improve data uploading and processing tasks.

For example, load_projects.py inserts projects and their associated facets to the database utilizing Django's ORM.

## Scripts Checklist

- Readable
- Maintainable
- Flexible

If one-off scripts need to be written (e.g. QA), **use scratch files instead**.
